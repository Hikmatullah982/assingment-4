<h1>What is a computer?</h1>
<hr width = 100%>
<p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A computer is an electronic device that stores and processes data.
A computer includes both hardware and software. In general, hardware comprises the visible,
physical elements of the computer, and software provides the invisible instructions that control
the hardware and make it perform specific tasks. Knowing computer hardware isn’t essential
to learning a programming language, but it can help you better understand the effects that
a program’s instructions have on the computer and its components. This section introduces
computer hardware components and their functions.
