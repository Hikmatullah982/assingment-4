    <u>Anna Karenina</u> tells of the <i><b>doomed</b></i> love affair between the <i><b>sensuous</b></i> and
    <i><b>rebellious</b></i> <u>Anna</u> and the <i><b>dashing</b></i> officer, <i>Count Vronsky.</i>
    Tragedy unfolds as <u>Anna</u> rejects her <b><i>passionless marriage</i></b>
    and must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a <i><b>vast</b></i> and richly textured canvas of
    nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out
    the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness.
    While previous versions have softened the robust, and sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's
    writing, <u>Pevear</u> and <u>Volokhonsky</u> have produced a translation true to his powerful voice.
    This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes an <i><b>illuminating</b></i> introduction
    and <i><b>explanatory</b></i> notes.
    <i><b>Beautiful</b></i>, <i><b>vigorous</b></i>, and <i><b>eminently</b></i>
    <i><b>readable</b></i>, this <u>Anna Karenina</u> will be the definitive text for generations to come.
